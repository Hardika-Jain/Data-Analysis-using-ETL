# Data-Analysis-using-ETL
Data Analysis using ETL: from APIs, through Python, into SQL Server.

About the project:
In this project, we will extract retail data from Kaggle APIs using Python. After fetching the data, we will preprocess it by cleaning and transforming it into structured formats using Pandas. Once the data is cleaned and processed, it will be loaded into a SQL Server database for further analysis. SQL queries and operations will be performed on the data to derive valuable business insights, helping to understand patterns, trends, and opportunities within the retail industry.
Key Steps:
Data Extraction: Utilizing Kaggle APIs to fetch retail datasets.
Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw data using Pandas to ensure quality and consistency.
Data Loading: Importing the processed data into SQL Server for further operations.
Data Analytics: Running SQL queries to generate insights for business decision-making.
